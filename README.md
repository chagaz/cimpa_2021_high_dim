# CIMPA Lomé 2021 | ML & Health | Feature selection in high dimension
Notebooks for my course on feature selection in high dimension at the CIMPA Lomé 2021 school

To use with Google Colab:
* go to https://colab.research.google.com
* choose to open a notebook from GitHub.
* paste the repository's URL: https://github.com/chagaz/cimpa_2021_high_dim

Make sure to download the `data/` folder and place it at the same level as your notebook in colab!

One approach to do this:
* create a new cell and run the following command in it: `!git clone https://github.com/chagaz/cimpa_2021_high_dim`
* open the file navigator on the left by clicking on the folder icon
* select the folder called `data/` under `cimpa_2021_high_dim` and drag-and-drop it to the same level as your notebook.
